# 🧬 BioSign: A Data Science Exploration

Welcome to **BioSign**, a mini data science project exploring the intersections of **genetic aging** and **biometric signatures**. This notebook-driven project analyzes curated datasets to derive meaningful insights into aging-related genes and behavioral traits using data visualization and machine learning techniques.

---

## 📖 Problem Statement

**Objective**: To uncover correlations and patterns within biological datasets that pertain to aging and human signatures.

The project is divided into two primary explorations:

1. **Genetic Aging** – Analyze the _GenAge Human_ dataset to identify trends, functional groupings, and influential genes responsible for cellular and whole-body aging.
2. **Signature Analysis** – Examine a dataset of handwritten signatures to understand variation patterns, potentially useful in identity verification or behavioral analysis.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

- Preprocessed datasets using `pandas` and `numpy` for analysis-ready formats.
- Explored and visualized genetic aging data to extract biological significance and frequency patterns.
- Investigated signature datasets for distribution and visual patterns using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Animated the notebook with GIFs for better visual engagement and presentation impact.
- A final project report summarizes the approach and findings.

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### 🧬 Genetic Aging Dataset

- Dataset: `Genage_human.csv`
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
  - Identified most frequent aging-related genes
  - Analyzed by functional category, gene family, evidence type
  - Visualizations included pie charts, bar plots, and histograms

### ✍️ Signature Dataset

- Dataset: `signatures1.csv`
- Explored visual and numeric signature attributes
- Plotted signature curve characteristics and distribution
- Potential insights into individual behavior and pattern uniqueness

### 📽️ Visuals and GIFs

- GIFs were embedded to enhance user engagement and guide viewers through transitions in the notebook
